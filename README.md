# I.T Security Labs - Companion GitHub Repository

Welcome to the **I.T Security Labs** companion GitHub repository! This repository is designed to complement my YouTube channel, where I create tutorials for cybersecurity beginners. Here, you'll find code snippets, write-ups, and resources that accompany the videos on my channel.

## 📺 **YouTube Channel**

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository contains the following resources:

1. **Code Snippets**: Scripts and code examples used in my tutorials.
2. **Write-ups**: Detailed explanations and guides on various cybersecurity topics.
3. **Tools**: Configuration files and tools used in the demonstrations.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

To get started with the content in this repository, follow these steps:

## 1. **Access the Repository**

- Navigate through the different folders for code snippets and write-ups.
- Each folder corresponds to a specific video or topic covered on my YouTube channel.

## 🛠️ **Usage**

## Code Snippets:

- The code snippets provided are meant to be run in your own lab environment (e.g., Kali Linux, Metasploitable, etc.).
- Follow along with the corresponding YouTube tutorials for step-by-step guidance on how to use each script.

## Write-ups:

- The write-ups provide in-depth explanations of various cybersecurity concepts and techniques.
- They are designed to reinforce what you learn in the videos and give you additional context.

## 📚 **Example Usage**

Here’s an example of how to use one of the scripts from the repository:

## Example: Running a Bash Script for Reconnaissance

1. Navigate to the `recon-scripts` folder:bash
    
    `cd IT-Security-Labs/recon-scripts`
    
2. Run the script:bash
    
    `bash recon.sh`
    
3. Follow along with the corresponding video tutorial for a detailed walkthrough of how this script works.

## 🔧 **Tools & Requirements**

Most of the writeups or scripts require having access to a personal cyber range (personal lab). You can deploy yours by following videos on my channel, for example
- To setup a **Purple Team** lab where you learn both offensive and defensive skills, you cal use the [NHA-GOAD series videos on youtube
](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyJqGMYm0vnOePYQvWgwiQLnfhLHWZxlF)- Metasploit
- If you are studying for the OSCP, checkout the [OSCP Hackthebox Vulnhub playlist
](https://studio.youtube.com/playlist/PLyJqGMYm0vnMqR-BXa0i44uj6Qb1IxeNv/edit)- 

Make sure you have a safe lab environment to practice hands on labs.

## 📝 **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork this repository.
